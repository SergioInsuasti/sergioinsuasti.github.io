## Profile
I am a Data Engineer with extensive technical development experience working with data in the Finance, Banking and Insurance domains. After a brief hiatus to help run the family restaurant business, I am returning to the corporate world. I have extensive experience working with databases, cleaning & mapping data to function with other applications and managing data migration projects. I recently completed a Data Science immersive course which has provided me with the additional skills required to pivot into a Data Engineer role. With the increasing demand for automation, algorithms and machine learning that has evolved in such a short time it makes it a great challenge and a great time to return.
